Each light represents a cell. Like synapses in the brain they react to the surrounding impulses.
The controller defines rules for how each cell is excited by the cells that neighbor it.
The lights looping around the mirror and many reflections represent the infinite feedback loop that sustains your consciousness.
Look within to see yourself.
